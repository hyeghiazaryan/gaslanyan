        Hi there!
        <br/>
        I’m Gabby, a web/UX/UI designer based in the greater Seattle area. 
        I love designing everything, from logos and websites to houses, interiors, and cartoon characters. 
        <br/>
        I’m originally from Armenia and I moved to the US in 2011 with my husband. We have two kids.
        My hobbies include architecture, classical art in any form, hiking, and traveling with my family.
        <br/>
        
        And yes, crazy hair is my thing  :)
