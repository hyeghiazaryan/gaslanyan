        Hi there!
        <br/>
        I’m Gabby, a web/UX/UI designer based in the greater Seattle area. 
        I love designing everything, starting from logos and websites up to houses, interiors and cartoon characters. 
        <br/>
        I’m originally from Armenia. I moved to the US in 2011 with my husband. We have two kids. 
        My hobbies include architecture, quality classical art in any form, hiking and traveling with my family.
        <br/>
        
        And yes, crazy hair is my thing  :)
